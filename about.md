  Hey there!
</p>

*Student Life* - I am a Computer Science & Engineering graduate working from [National Institute of Technology, Warangal](http://www.nitw.ac.in). I graduated in 2015 with a Bachelors degree in CS. I'm inclined to do my masters or PhD, but currently I have not given a lot of thought to further formal education.

*Programmer by choice* - I have been programming for about 4 years now. Wrote my first line of code in Visual Basic and then moved to learning Java as a subject in school. Although at that time most of OOP didn't make sense, but today its one powerful concept I use for everyday problem solving. I propagate Object Oriented Programming and consider everything as an Object in this world!

*Then came Linux* - Something called a *shell* or *terminal* was introduced to me in first year of college during the Programming Lab. I fell in love with the Terminal the moment I started using it, and became sure that Computers were meant for me. The first linux distribution I used was in 2011 which was Ubuntu 11.04. I did all sorts of experiments with Linux Distributions in my second year of college, and nearly every week I was formatting my computer and installing a new Operating System, and it was during this time I found GNOME Desktop Environment with Fedora distribution and really liked it alot.

*Present* - I am working on take over the world as other Geeks (Its ON!) using Coffee & Pizza (Coffee + Pizza = Code). I like to code from system level C to web development in Python, and everything in between which you can think of. Working on some cool projects which you would be notified by my [blog posts](http://imrashid.com). I worked at [EdgeVerve Systems](https://www.edgeverve.com) as a Product Engineer from June, 2015 to September, 2015. At EdgeVerve I was at Incubation Team and my day to day work focussed on building IoT prototypes and backend systems to support IoT devices. I quit my job to start [Yellow Messenger](https://www.yellowmessenger.com) with my college senior Raghu, Anik and Kishore. At Yellow Messenger, I hack on everything from iOS to NodeJS to build our product. I'm quite fascinated with the developments in the Artificial Intelligence and would love to work on building next generation AI products. My current job does involve doing a lot of AI for understanding user queries. Do check out Yellow Messenger, we have released the [Android App](https://bit.ly/yellowmssngr).

*May the force be with you*
