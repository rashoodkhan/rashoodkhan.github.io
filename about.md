  Hey there!
</p>

I am a Computer Science & Engineering student at National Institute of Technology, Warangal (India), presently in my third(pre-final) year of study.

*Programmer by choice* - I have been programming for about 4 years now. Wrote my first line of code in Visual Basic and then moved to learning Java as a subject in school. Although at that time most of OOP didn't make sense, but today its one powerful concept I use for everyday problem solving. I propagate Object Oriented Programming and consider everything as an Object in this world!

*Then came Linux* - Something called a *shell* or *terminal* was introduced to me in first year of college during the Programming Lab. I fell in love with the Terminal the moment I started using it, and became sure that Computers were meant for me. The first linux distribution I used was in 2011 which was Ubuntu 11.04. I did all sorts of experiments with Linux Distributions in my second year of college, and nearly every week I was formatting my computer and installing a new Operating System, and it was during this time I found GNOME Desktop Environment with Fedora distribution and really liked it alot.

*Present* - I am working on take over the world as other Geeks (Its ON!) using Coffee & Pizza (Coffee + Pizza = Code). I like to code from system level C to web development in Python, and everything in between which you can think of. Working on some cool projects which you would be notified by my [blog posts](http://imrashid.com)

Thanks for reading!
