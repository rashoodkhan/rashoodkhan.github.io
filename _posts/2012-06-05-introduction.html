<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Well, technically this is my second post on the blog. I had made another blog a year back, its url is theguywhoreadlittle.tumblr.com</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Anyway, I always wanted a blog on Blogger, for reasons unknown. I think maybe it looks cool. And I finally have it now. I am no great writer, leave alone "great", I am no writer. Today I feel I am nobody in this world; Its not that I am feeling lonely or anything. I sat down today evening in a great conversation with my myself and realised I have not achieved anything worth in this 19 years of life yet. I have had access to the best of best facilities, and I made no good use of anything available to me. I don't regret anything though. Its just its the thought which sometimes makes you think</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">"WHO YOU ACTUALLY ARE? WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT?"</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">And trust me, I have not got the answers of the two questions above. I am a student of Computer Science and Engineering in the country of 2 Billion people, 2000 Languages, Birth place of many religions, "0" was invented here; and by now you would have guessed which country I belong to. Yes, Its INDIA, HINDUSTAN, BHARAT.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">There's nothing much Indian about me, except for my passport and colour. Oh yes the "Indian" accent too. I have lived in gulf more the majority of my life. First in Saudi Arabia - the country where oil is cheaper than water; and you get a litre of petrol free with a bar of snickers , And then in Abu Dhabi : which is a distant cousin of Dubai and where Plate numbers are actually costlier than cars. Its actually very interesting that most people don't really know Abu Dhabi, but know Dubai.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">"Dubai : defined as The Vegas, without the casinos" - read it somewhere, can't recall at the moment where.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">I don't have any idea where this blog post is heading.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">I have too much in my small brain to write about. But now since I really want to maintain a blog, I will keep those topics for further posts. And let's hope the upcoming posts are well tailored and not written randomly on the night of 5-June-2012 at 11 am or so.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">This was supposed to be an introduction to me, but I felt that it should not matter to people.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">I am a person who is trying to create some changes around me, not for myself but for the people. Very small ones though.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">"Future belongs to whose who HOPE" - read it on my father's wallpaper.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Signing off</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">- The Guy Who Read Little</span><br /><br /></div>
