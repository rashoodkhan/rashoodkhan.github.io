24th Jan to 27th Jan - was AWESOME. Went in to two hackathons, and got to hack on to some awesome technologies. This was the first time I got to play around with [Google Glass][glass]. Google glass is taking Augmented Reality to a whole new level. Though the device is still in not in production, it is very stable - used it without any crashes! Yayee. The only issue I faced was the constant usage of Glass for 15 minutes or more heated it up to a level, where you can't wear it anymore and have to switch it down. I am still not complaining though ;)

Just say "Ok Glass", and it starts listening to your query, and the language processing is very fine even without internet connection. I managed to click couple of pictures and take around with it, and they turned out good even in low light. There is the gesture navigation for choosing apps, navigating home screen, and they work seamlessly well. The only constraint for me as a student, would be paying 1500$ for a glass! But I guess the price is well justified with the opportunities it offers.

At the Hackathon, which was conducted by [Lakshya Foundation][lakshya] one of the teams were trying to hack an app for Glass. They wanted to implement Smart Home devices with Glass and a Raspi. Seems like an awesome idea, right? They were succesful to make the Glass talk to an Android App (Kudos to them!), but due to lack of time they could not develop anything on the Raspi.

Now coming to what my team did, well we tried to stick to the basics and thought to go for Social Innovation. Our idea was to create a web application to notify parents about their child's up-coming Vaccination. The mail aim was to keep the communication between the app and parents using SMS, as there are still lots of parents who are not tech savy and don't use Smart Phones, hence the SMS. We used API from Twilio for sending SMS, and created the back-end using Django. Looking for good VM for hosting our service, and that should be finalized soon and are planning to take the idea forward and add couple of other features before doing a full fledged release.

To summarize, the last weekend was a blast for me. Google Glass + Vaccination App.
