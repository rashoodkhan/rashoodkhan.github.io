Let's see, can it be described first of all?

If you enjoy what you are doing you will automatically work hard. If you enjoy your work, you do not feel exhausted or bored and success gives you further boost to work more harder to maintain it. It is a chain reaction which continues"</i></b></span>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><br /></blockquote><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A few words, on how I feel about Success. Success is not made in numbers, you cannot be called successful if you are having Billions of Dollars in your Bank Account. Success is a state of heart and mind. It is state when you are content with what you do. It does not mean you stop working! Its just a small mile stone achieved when you look at the larger picture. Success does not involve just thyself, but other people who work/study/live with you. What use is the knowledge if you keep it behind the locked doors, and just scribble it on white paper, just for Numbers!</span><br /><div><br /></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Want to enjoy a glimpse of being Successful? Imagine, if a person smiles just because of your work, the immense happiness it gives to you. Now, Magnify the same Smiles to people around the world. Imagine the happiness that would bring? Cannot be described in words! :)</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span>  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://wallpaperswa.com/thumbnails/detail/20120505/rules%20gray%20quotes%20text%20only%20lincoln%20success%201920x1080%20wallpaper_wallpaperswa.com_77.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img border="0" height="221" src="http://wallpaperswa.com/thumbnails/detail/20120505/rules%20gray%20quotes%20text%20only%20lincoln%20success%201920x1080%20wallpaper_wallpaperswa.com_77.jpg" width="400" /></span></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><br /></span></td></tr></tbody></table><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span id="goog_812511957"></span><span id="goog_812511958"></span><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">- The Guy Who Read Little</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>

    I think sucess is a journey and what you receive is a part of it.If you have satisfaction and you have worked hard then u will always enjoy your sucess.<br /><br />For success or work to get done there are five things you require. First the intention of the person who is doing, then availability of the instruments or things needed to do the work, third is the willingness or mindset to do the work. Then doing the work at the right time, there is a time to do the work, if you donâ€™t do it at the right time then there is no use. If you sow seeds in February then there is no use, you then cannot say that I sowed the seeds but nothing has come. You have to wait till April after the rain and then you sow the seeds and yield the results. So time is a very important factor.<br />And without grace of the divine there will be no success<br />so Do your Karma and with that do the Seva and Sadhna. Your sucess should be benefecial to not only you but to whole society, to the mankind and it should reflect the true spirit of being you...and the most important <br />None of your efforts will go waste that you should be assured about, if not now you will see the results later.
