<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">This post is coming after a very long time, as my vacations were coming to an end. I was preparing for college, so the last few weeks was shopping, shopping and more of shopping. I felt like I was like the girl from "Confessions of a Shop-a-holic". I wanted whatever I saw, and one more reason being the Summer Surprises was on in Abu Dhabi/Dubai. At Summer Surprises, nearly every shop has sale ranging from 25% to anywhere till 75%. One reason being this, and the other I was LAZY.<br />Well, my travel date was 17th of July, boarding from Dubai, at 22:30 (local time). It was like just like any other flight. Window seats interest me a lot. The look as you slowly take off, leaving the glittering city of Dubai is beautiful. And then it was all Dark! I could not make out anything</div>
