So I setup my first personal [site][website]. Although I had a blog on [blogspot][blogspot-link] from a year or two?, but getting a [Github][github] powered blog is the *fad* among *Programmers*. I am really impressed with just a domain and a github account you can do so much, i.e. a personal blog without having a hosting plan and now that's Fancy!

I have been using [Github][github] for about 6 months now, but became really active in the past month. This change happened when I saw my name come up in Banshee's Contributor list on new year's eve, and decided that year 2014 should be the year of code and contribution.

Currently I am involved with [Tomboy][tomboy] and [Calculator][calculator] projects, both of them falling under the umbrella of GNOME. Tomboy is a note taking utility, and its one app which makes me highly productive as I keep notes for each and every conversation I have, be it with myself or others! The Calculator project is the standard Calculator which comes with GNOME distribution. More updates would follow on those and other projects on the [blog][website] with time.

This blog is built using [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosted on [Github][github_r]. Instructions on building the blog from scratch and hosting using Github would follow soon.

Goodnight!
